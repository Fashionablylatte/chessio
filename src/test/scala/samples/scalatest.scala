ScalaTest facilitates different styles of testing by providing traits you can mix
together to get the behavior and syntax you prefer.  A few examples are
included here.  For more information, visit:

http://www.scalatest.org/

One way to use ScalaTest is to help make JUnit or TestNG tests more
clear and concise. Here's an example:
*/
import scala.collection._
import org.scalatest.Assertions
import org.junit.Test

class StackSuite extends Assertions {

  @Test def stackShouldPopValuesIinLastInFirstOutOrder() {
    val stack = new mutable.Stack[Int]
    stack.push(1)
    stack.push(2)
    assert(stack.pop() === 2)
    assert(stack.pop() === 1)
  }

  @Test def stackShouldThrowRuntimeExceptionIfAnEmptyArrayStackIsPopped() {
    val emptyStack = new mutable.ArrayStack[String]
    intercept[RuntimeException] {
      emptyStack.pop()
    }
  }
}
